### Start Development Server

This project is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and uses TypeScript to provide a fast, modern development experience for building and previewing web components.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Starts Vite in development mode
- Opens the app at http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)
- Supports hot module replacement (HMR) for fast feedback

---

### Build Project

```bash
npm run build
```

- Compiles and bundles the project for production
- Outputs optimised files into the dist/ directory

---

### Build Muibook

```bash
npm run build:muibook
```

- Builds the Muibook package using a custom Vite config (vite.muibook.config.ts)
- Produces a minified CSS and JS build for documentation

---

### Preview Muibook Build

```bash
npm run preview:muibook
```

- Serves the minified Muibook build locally for previewing the compiled output

---

### Build Create Mui App

```bash
npm run build:create-mui-app
```

- Builds the create-mui-app package using a custom Vite config (vite.create-mui-app.config.ts)
- Produces a minified CSS and JS build for documentation

---

### Preview Create Mui App Build

```bash
npm run preview:create-mui-app
```

- Serves the minified create-mui-app build locally for previewing the compiled output

---

### Setup

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### TypeScript Support:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

---

### VS Code Plug-in

Install [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) for better HTML template literal syntax highlighting.

---

### Publishing

#### Version Management

```bash
npm version patch  # Increment patch version
npm version minor  # Increment minor version
npm version major  # Increment major version
```

#### Test Before Publishing

```bash
npm pack --dry-run  # Preview what will be published
```

#### Publish to NPM

```bash
npm publish
```

---

### Development Notes

- Add any new components to `vite.config.ts` to include them in builds
- The dist/ folder is published, while source code and src/muibook are excluded
- Use the preview scripts to verify production builds before deployment
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Slot Implementation Approach (MUI Design System)

When implementing slots in MUI components, we use a consistent approach for styling and interaction:

#### Children Concerns

- We use JavaScript to query and manage slotted elements.
- To apply styles to a slotted item, we append a class in the format: [parent-component]-slot.
- The slotted component detects this class via :host(.parent-component) and applies the relevant styles.

#### Parent Concerns

- If the parent component needs to react to the presence of a specific slotted item, we add an attribute like has-[slottedComponentName] to the host.
- The parent component can then target this via :host([has-slottedComponentName]) for conditional styling.

This method keeps slot behavior declarative and styles predictable across components.
